## About
A real-life adaptation of *Among Us* that uses a Telegram bot to manage gameplay. Players join a live game, find assigned targets in person, and "eliminate" them by collecting unique codes. The last player standing is declared the winner.

## Features
- âœ… Real-time target assignment and reassignment upon eliminations
- âœ… Automated tracking of player stats, kills, and inactivity
- âœ… Top-player rankings and progress tracking during gameplay
- âœ… Direct support communication with game administrators
